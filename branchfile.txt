Git merge
  git merge combines a branch into the main. This then allows both the branch and main to be on the same page at that point in time

Git add
  git add puts new files into tracking, so the repo knows to add any new files into the repo.

Git rebase
  git rebase makes it so the code is combined starting from the most recent of the main and allows for a cleaner flow of history in the repo.


Git pull
  git pull 'pulls' the most recent version of the repo from the remote server.
